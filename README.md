## Setting up the API key
In order to use the OpenAI API, you must have bought credits (as of Dec 2023)
and produced an API key after purchasing credits.

Then, you must add the API key to your ~/.bash_profile file as detailed on the
OpenAI API Quickstart guide.

Note: after purchasing credits, your account may take some time (up to a day) to
be functional. Before that, you may run into errors when trying to make API calls.
