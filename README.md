# GPT vs itself

This small library allows for two OpenAI GPT assistants to have a discussion
about any topic of your choosing.

## How to run
- Set up your OpenAI API key, as described below
- Install the packages found in requirements.txt into your environment
- (Optional) Change the parameters at the top of main.py
- Run main.py

## Setting up the API key
In order to use the OpenAI API, you must have bought credits (as of Dec 2023)
and produced an API key after purchasing credits.

Then, you must add the API key to your ~/.bash_profile file as detailed on the
OpenAI API Quickstart guide.

Note: after purchasing credits, your account may take some time (up to a day) to
be functional. Before that, you may run into errors when trying to make API calls.
